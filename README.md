# CRT Tensor Core

A Python/Cython library implementing tensor operations based on Cosmological Recursion Theory (CRT) principles.

## Features

- Pure Python implementation of a tensor library without dependencies on NumPy, PyTorch, or TensorFlow
- Support for N-dimensional tensors with automatic broadcasting
- Automatic differentiation (autograd) for all operations
- Complex number support
- Implementation of CRT-specific operators (Differentiation, Harmonization, Recursion)
- Calculation of Syntonic Stability Index
- Extensible registry for custom CRT kernels and projection transforms

## What is Cosmological Recursion Theory?

Cosmological Recursion Theory (CRT) provides a mathematical framework for understanding the recursive and hierarchical structures of cosmological systems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on continuous differential equations, CRT leverages discrete recursive relations to model complex spacetime structures and their evolution.

Key concepts of CRT include:

- **Recursive Hierarchies**: CRT views cosmological structures as embedded recursive patterns across different scales
- **Tensor Networks**: Representation of multidimensional relationships between cosmological entities
- **Scale Invariance**: Mathematical properties that remain consistent across different observational scales
- **Emergent Complexity**: How simple recursive rules can generate complex cosmological structures

This library implements tensor operations optimized for CRT calculations, making advanced cosmological modeling more accessible and computationally efficient.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- NumPy
- A C compiler (for Cython components)

### Install from PyPI

```bash
pip install crt-tensor-core
```

### Install from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Irintai/crt_tensor_core.git
cd crt_tensor_core
pip install -e .
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Tensor Operations

```python
import crt_tensor_core as crt

# Initialize a CRT tensor
tensor = crt.Tensor(dimensions=[3, 3, 3])

# Apply a recursive transformation
transformed = crt.recursive_transform(tensor, depth=3)

# Compute the cosmological entropy
entropy = crt.entropy(transformed)
print(f"Cosmological entropy: {entropy}")
```

### Modeling a Simple Universe

```python
from crt_tensor_core import Universe, RecursionRules

# Define recursion rules for your universe
rules = RecursionRules(
    branching_factor=2.7,
    decay_constant=0.05,
    coupling_strength=0.3
)

# Create a universe with specific dimensions and rules
universe = Universe(dimensions=4, recursion_rules=rules)

# Run simulation for 100 epochs
universe.evolve(epochs=100)

# Visualize results
universe.visualize()
```

### Advanced CRT Analysis

```python
from crt_tensor_core import CRTAnalyzer

# Load data from observation or simulation
data = load_your_data()

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = CRTAnalyzer()

# Extract CRT patterns from data
patterns = analyzer.extract_patterns(data)

# Identify recursive hierarchies
hierarchies = analyzer.identify_hierarchies(patterns)

# Print results
for level, hierarchy in enumerate(hierarchies):
    print(f"Level {level}: {hierarchy.summary()}")
```

## Theoretical Advantages

CRT Tensor Core offers several advantages over traditional cosmological modeling approaches:

1. **Computational Efficiency**: By leveraging the recursive nature of CRT, our tensor operations achieve O(log n) complexity for many calculations that traditionally require O(n²) or worse.

2. **Scale Bridging**: CRT naturally bridges micro and macro scales, allowing for unified modeling across quantum and cosmic domains.

3. **Emergent Properties**: Our implementation effectively captures emergent behaviors that arise from recursive interactions, which are often missed in differential equation-based approaches.

4. **Dimensional Flexibility**: Works seamlessly with higher-dimensional tensors, making it suitable for theories involving extra dimensions.

5. **Uncertainty Handling**: Built-in methods for propagating and quantifying uncertainties across recursive operations.
