# CRT Tensor Core

A tensor library for Cosmological Recursion Theory (CRT) operations, implementing the mathematical foundations described in CRT.

## Features

- Pure Python implementation of a tensor library without dependencies on NumPy, PyTorch, or TensorFlow
- Support for N-dimensional tensors with automatic broadcasting
- Automatic differentiation (autograd) for all operations
- Complex number support
- Implementation of CRT-specific operators (Differentiation, Harmonization, Recursion)
- Calculation of Syntonic Stability Index
- Extensible registry for custom CRT kernels and projection transforms

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/crt_tensor_core.git
cd crt_tensor_core
pip install .
